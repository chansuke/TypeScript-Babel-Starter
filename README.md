# TypeScript-Babel-Webpack-Starter

**Note**: This quick start repository uses a pre-release version of Babel. While you should be aware that some of the dependencies here are in flux, feel free to try it out!

# What is this?
This is cloned from [TypeScript-Babel-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Babel-Starter) and added webpack and so on to reduce the initial cost of starting your project.
This is a small sample repository that uses Babel to transform TypeScript to plain JavaScript, and uses TypeScript for type-checking.
This README will also explain step-by-step how you can set up this repository so you can understand how each component fits together.

For simplicity, we've used `babel-cli` with a bare-bones TypeScript setup, but we'll also demonstrate integration with JSX/React, as well as adding Webpack into the mix.

# How do I use it(WIP)?

```sh
yarn build
```

## Type-checking the repo

yarn type-check
```

And to run in `--watch` mode:

```sh

```

# How would I set this up myself?
